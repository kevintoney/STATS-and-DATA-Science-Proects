# Research Question & Background

## Questions

- What factors influence a player's free throw percentage for good or for bad? 
- What makes a free throw shooter miss?
- Does crowd noise make a difference?

## What we did to find out!

- We asked 20 people to shoot 20 free throws.
- Before they shot the free throws, we separated them, with the help of a random number generator, into four different groups. Each group represented a different situation. Each situation is shown in the table below. 

```{r, echo=F}

```

# Experimental Design

## Statistical Model

\begin{itemize}
\item We used the following statistical model to design our experiment:
\item $x_{ijk} = µ + Noise_j + Inflation_j + Interaction_{jk} + \epsilon_{ijk}$
\begin{itemize}
\item µ = overall mean
\item $Noise_j$ = effect due to j th level of “Noise" factor
\item $Inflation_k$ = effect due to kth level of “Inflation" factor
\item $Interaction_{jk}$ = effect due to interaction between levels j and k
\item $x_{ijk}$ = observed outcome for individual i
\item $\epsilon_{ijk}$ = random error associated with individual i
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Experimental Design

- 2x2 Basic Factorial Design
- Factor 1: Crowd Noise
- Factor 2: Inflation Level
- Control: Shooting free throws without noise and with an inflated ball


# Results

## The Experiment's Results

![Data table for the results](results_table.png)

## Precautions against confounding variables

- I put the data into a binomial distribution to make each shooter independent of each other. 

# Analysis

## Notes for Reference
- The variances of each group are not similar. In order to run and ANOVA regression model, we made a log transformation to the data so the data had variances that were more alike. 
- We found an interaction between noise and inflation.

## The Interaction Plots

## Method of Analysis
- We performed a poisson regression model to compare the average amount of shots made per player.
- In poisson regression, the null deviance is the base model. If we do regression for all three factors, the degrees of freedom is 16.

## Significant Findings

``` {r, tidy= TRUE, dpi= 80}
pois_diff <- 35.945 - 22.174
1 - pchisq(pois_diff, df=3)
pois_diff_2 <- 35.945 - 25.802
1 - pchisq(pois_diff_2, df=2)
pois_diff_3 <- 25.825 - 25.802
1 - pchisq(pois_diff_3, df=1)
pois_diff_4 <- 35.922 - 25.802
1 - pchisq(pois_diff_4, df=1)
```

- The inflation levels in the ball and the interaction between noise and inflation make a statistically significant difference on the amount of made free throws by a free throw shooter after 20 attempts.

# Conclusions

## So what?

- Now, do these statistically significant factors have a practical significance? The predict.glm function will help us determine statistical significance.
``` {r, echo = F, out.width = '80%'}
rm(list=ls())
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(width = 80)
library(ggplot2)

#My data is following a binomial distribution.
#I also have a sample size of 20 for each of the 20 shooters
#That sample size is enough for binomial regression.

#variances, in regards to p, will variable. p, the proportion of
#each shooter will be a random variable. log tranformations
#help account for the variability. 
#each five people in a group will have a p. value. 
#CLT theorem for each group 5*20 shots will 
#help estimate p values. Variance of a proportion is
#pi *(1-pi)/n. Variance of proportion is .05/10. 

freethrows = read.table("Free Throws.csv", header=T,sep=",") 
#the reponse variable has a unit of makes per attempts
#since I divided the makes by 20 attempts, the amount of significant digits decreased from 4
#I found the median to be 0.475.

######## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS######### 

freethrows$Group = as.factor(freethrows$Group) 
freethrows$Noise = as.factor(freethrows$Noise) 
freethrows$Inflation = as.factor(freethrows$Inflation) 

#are my ANOVA assumptions met from using a log transformation? Yes
logsurv = log(freethrows$Response)##Log Transformation## 

#binomial regression
reg1 <- glm(freethrows$Response~Inflation+Noise+Inflation*Noise, family=binomial, data=freethrows)

#null deviance is the base model. 
#16 degrees of freedom come after taking the three factors. 
#3 degree of freedom and a chi square of 1.2. 

#try running a poisson regression
#I am running GLM on the regular data, not log transformations
reg_pois1 <- glm(freethrows$Response*20~Inflation+Noise+Inflation*Noise, 
                 family=poisson, data=freethrows)
predict.glm(reg_pois1, type = "link")
```
- In my opinion, the difference between the null model (1.6864) and the inflation factor (2.4849) is big enough (0.7985) to be practically significant. I believe this is true because that difference would be a four percent difference in a shooter's free throw percentage.

## Conclusion
- Finally, my research concludes that basketball players will not be affected enough by crowd noise alone or by the interaction of noise and inflation.
